# **_Flask Task Manager_**
This project is a tutorial compiled by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). This tutorial will illustrate the [Python](https://www.python.org/) capabilities used in conjunction with [Flask Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).


One of the most interesting parts of this tutorial was the ability to use the CRUD principle with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to be able to exchange data with the backend .

The project was realized with the use of templates taken from [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/).

The app will be deployed with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
